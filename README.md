# esx_drugfarms

This plugin, which is originally based on [vrp_drugfarms by D3uxx](https://github.com/D3uxx/vrp_drugfarms), enables weed farms, the meth lab, coke lab and a biker club house from GTA: Online in esx.

## Dependencies

- [es_extended](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended)
- [esx_policejob](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_policejob/) (optional)

Note: not having `esx_policejob` running won't have any negative side effects. If you use another police plugin which has a jobId different than `police`, you can change the value in `config.lua`.

## Installation

1. Place this folder in `resources/[esx]`
2. Configure the plugin in `config.lua`
3. Add `start esx_drugfarms` to your `server.cfg`

## Usage

1. Go to marker
2. Press `e`/interact
